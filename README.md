# JSON Script

a lightweight javascript interpreter for a JSON-based scripting language.

## Syntax
* A script is an array of expressions to be evaluated.
* An expression is an `Object` who's key is a `command` and value is it's input parameters.
* Parameters are also an array of expressions.  
* If only one expression, no need for the Array
* if the expression is a literal, no need for the object (i.e. string or number)
